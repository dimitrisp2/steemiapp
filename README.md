# SteemiAPP

SteemiAPP is a free (and now open source) app to check how you are doin' on Steemit!

## Getting Started with the project

This project is developed using the latest B4A version (at the time of commiting this README, it is v8.00)

### Prerequisites/Libraries

To succesfully compile this project, you need the following B4A libraries:

- AHPreferenceAbility (you can download it [here](https://www.b4x.com/android/forum/threads/ahpreferenceactivity-library.12666/) for free, if you have a valid B4A license)
- JSON (included in B4A)
- OkHttpUtils2 (included in B4A)
- Phone (included in B4A)

### Installing & Testing

To test the codebase, you need an android phone (v4.0+ required, v8.1 recommended) and B4A Bridge (you can find it on Play Store). If you just want the app as a user, find [SteemiAPP on Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.dimitrisp.steenfo)

## Versioning

I'm using incremental release numbers instead of semantic versioning while the app is in beta. As soon as it is out of beta, I will be following semantic versioning, starting as 1.0.0, and there will be a codename for each minor version (major.minor.release). For example, the first public non-beta version will be SteemiAPP Amberdawn v1.0.0
